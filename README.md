AIRLIFT
=========

Technology has a huge role to play in disaster relief and recovery. Let's rework
Dinner Dash to help get relief supplies to the people and places that need them.

* Users register on the site as either suppliers (*the business*) or service
providers (*the customer*)
* A supplier has a listings page with all their available supplies
* A listing has a title, description, categories, quantity available, unit size,
current location, shippable indicator, unit weight
* A service provider can browse the site and view all available supplies
* They can add one or more supplies to their cart
* During checkout they can choose to (a) pickup the supplies and request a
pickup day/time or (b) request delivery and set their current location using GPS coordinates
* The suppliers are notifed that a new request has come in

Disaster areas probably don't have desktops, electricity, and internet
access. This project needs to be built targeting *mobile web* and *SMS* where
appropriate.
